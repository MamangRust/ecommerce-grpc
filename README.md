# 🛍️ Monolithic eCommerce Backend — Go Edition

A ECommerce backend built with **Go**, using **Echo** as the HTTP web framework, **PostgreSQL** for relational data, and **SQLC** for type-safe database access. Unlike microservice-based systems, all modules are part of a single application, making it easier to manage, test, and deploy.
